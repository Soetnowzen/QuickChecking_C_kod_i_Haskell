\section{Context}

% Use one or two high quality references for providing evidence from the literature that the proposed study indeed includes scientific and engineering challenges, or is related to existing ones.
% Convince the reader that the problem addressed in this thesis has not been solved prior to this project.

Prior work has already been done towards QuickChecking libraries in Erlang \citep{QuickCheckAUTOSAR}.
However, this particular tool utilises Erlang instead of Haskell and isn't an open-source project.
% non commerce use?

Similarly there exists property based testing libraries in C \citep{theft}.
This leaves us with a very interesting options, to extend Haskells QuickChecking to be able to test C libraries.
