\section{Context}

% Use one or two high quality references for providing evidence from the literature that the proposed study indeed includes scientific and engineering challenges, or is related to existing ones.
% Convince the reader that the problem addressed in this thesis has not been solved prior to this project.

Prior work has already been done towards QuickChecking other languages in Erlang \citep{QuickCheckAUTOSAR}.
One of QuviQ services is to property based test code through their Erlang QuickCheck.
However, this particular tool utilises Erlang instead of Haskell and isn't an open-source project. % non commerce use?

Similarly there exists property based testing libraries in C \citep{theft}.
This leaves us with a very interesting options, to extend Haskells module QuickCheck to be able to test C libraries.
More importantly to generate the boiler plate code.
