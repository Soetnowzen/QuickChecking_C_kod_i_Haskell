\section{Introduction}
%There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
%There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Briefly describe and motivate the project, and convince the reader of the importance of the proposed thesis work.
A good introduction will answer these questions:
Why is addressing these challenges significant for gaining new knowledge in the studied domain?
How and where can this new knowledge be applied?

Build a tool that one can use to QuickCheck C code against a Haskell specification.
Use this to test open-source libraries in C, for example for datastructures, image manipulation, compression, encryption, etc.
This tool will be a good way to streamline the testing to ensure software quality.
